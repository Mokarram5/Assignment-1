    "   - Variance is a statistical measure that quantifies the dispersion of data points around the mean. In the context of PCA, the variance is calculated along each principal component. The principal components are ordered based on the amount of variance they capture, with the first component capturing the most variance, the second component capturing the second most, and so on.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Eigenvalues and Variance:**\r\n",
    "   - In PCA, the eigenvalues associated with each principal component indicate the amount of variance along that component. Larger eigenvalues correspond to more significant amounts of variance. The total variance of the dataset is the sum of all eigenvalues.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Spread along Principal Components:**\r\n",
    "   - The spread of data points along a principal component is related to the eigenvalue associated with that component. A larger eigenvalue indicates a greater spread of data points along that specific direction in the feature space.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Variance Explained:**\r\n",
    "   - The concept of \"variance explained\" in PCA refers to the proportion of total variance captured by a particular principal component. It is calculated as the ratio of the eigenvalue of the principal component to the sum of all eigenvalues (total variance).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   \\[ \\text{Variance Explained} = \\frac{\\text{Eigenvalue of Principal Component}}{\\text{Sum of All Eigenvalues}} \\]\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "   - A principal component that captures a higher proportion of total variance is considered more important in representing the overall variability in the dataset.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "6. **Principal Components and Data Spread:**\r\n",
    "   - The principal components are chosen such that they form an orthogonal basis that aligns with the directions of maximum data spread. The first principal component captures the direction of maximum variance, the second principal component captures the direction of second maximum variance, and so on.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In summary, in PCA, the terms \"spread\" and \"variance\" are closely related. The spread of data points along principal components reflects the variance in those directions. The eigenvalues associated with each principal component quantify the amount of variance explained by that component, and the cumulative sum of eigenvalues represents the total variance in the dataset. The choice of principal components is driven by the goal of capturing the maximum amount of variance, which corresponds to the spread of data points in the feature space.r of dimensions to retain."

    "\r\n",
    "1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**\r\n",
    "   - **Description:** PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional representation, capturing the most significant variations in the data.\r\n",
    "   - **Role of Eigen-Decomposition:** PCA is based on the eigen decomposition of the covariance matrix of the data.

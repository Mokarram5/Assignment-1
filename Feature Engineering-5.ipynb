    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables based on the mean of the target variable for each category. This method is particularly useful when dealing with ordinal categorical variables where the order among categories has significance in relation to the target variable.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Calculate the Mean of the Target Variable for Each Category:**\r\n",
    "   - For each unique category in the ordinal variable, calculate the mean of the target variable. This means finding the average of the target variable for rows where the category is present.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Order the Categories Based on the Mean:**\r\n",
    "   - Order the categories based on their mean values. This establishes an ordinal relationship among the categories, reflecting their impact on the target variable.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Assign Ordinal Labels:**\r\n",
    "   - Assign ordinal labels to the categories based on their order of means. The category with the lowest mean gets the lowest label, and the category with the highest mean gets the highest label.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Example:**\r\n",
    "Suppose you have an ordinal variable \"Education Level\" with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"Ph.D.\" The target variable is binary, indicating whether a person will purchase a premium product or not.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "| Education Level | Target (Purchase) |\r\n",
    "|-----------------|---------------------|\r\n",
    "| High School     | 0                   |\r\n",
    "| Bachelor's      | 1                   |\r\n",
    "| Master's        | 1                   |\r\n",
    "| Ph.D.           | 1                   |\r\n",
    "| High School     | 0                   |\r\n",
    "| Master's        | 1                   |\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Calculation of Means:**\r\n",
    "- High School: \\( (0 + 0) / 2 = 0 \\)\r\n",
    "- Bachelor's: \\( 1 / 1 = 1 \\)\r\n",
    "- Master's: \\( (1 + 1) / 2 = 1 \\)\r\n",
    "- Ph.D.: \\( 1 / 1 = 1 \\)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Ordering based on Means:**\r\n",
    "- High School (0)\r\n",
    "- Bachelor's (1)\r\n",
    "- Master's (1)\r\n",
    "- Ph.D. (1)\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Assigning Ordinal Labels:**\r\n",
    "- High School: 1\r\n",
    "- Bachelor's: 2\r\n",
    "- Master's: 3\r\n",
    "- Ph.D.: 4\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Now, the \"Education Level\" variable is encoded with ordinal labels reflecting the average likelihood of purchasing a premium product for each education level.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "**Use Case:**\r\n",
    "You might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in a machine learning project when dealing with ordinal variables like \"Education Level,\" \"Income Level,\" or \"Job Seniority,\" where the order of categories is expected to have a meaningful impact on the target variable. This technique can enhance the model's ability to capture the ordinal relationships in such variables, potentially leading to improved predictive performance. model training.t may not capture feature interactions as effectively.ut may overlook such interactions."

    "Covariance is a statistical measure that quantifies the degree to which two variables change together. It assesses the joint variability of two random variables. A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance suggests that one variable increases as the other decreases.\r\n",

    "1. **Relationship Strength:** It provides insights into the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.\r\n",
    "2. **Portfolio Management:** In finance, covariance is used to assess the risk and diversification benefits of combining different assets in a portfolio.\r\n",
    "3. **Regression Analysis:** Covariance is involved in the calculation of regression coefficients, helping understand the relationship between independent and dependent variables.\r\n",
    "4. **Multivariate Analysis:** In multivariate statistics, covariance matrices are crucial for understanding relationships among multiple vation in sample data.\r\n",

    "The resulting covariance can be interpreted as follows:\r\n",
    "- Positive covariance: Variables tend to move together.\r\n",
    "- Negative covariance: Variables tend to move in opposite directions.\r\n",
    "- Covariance near zero: Variables show little linear relationship.\r\n",

    "Similar to Temperature, the covariance between Humidity and categorical variables indicates the average variation in Humidity with different categories.\r\n",

    "Covariance is sensitive to the scales of the variables, making it challenging to compare directly.\r\n",
    "The use of covariance for categorical-continuous pairs can be limited, especially when comparing covariances across different variables."

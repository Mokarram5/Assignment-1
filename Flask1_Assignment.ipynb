    "App routing in Flask refers to the process of defining URL routes for different parts of a web application. It involves mapping specific URLs to Python functions, allowing the application to respond to different requests. We use app routes for the following reasons:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **URL Handling:** App routes help define the structure of a web application by specifying which function should handle specific URLs, making it easy to organize and manage the application's behavior.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Endpoint Mapping:** They provide a clean way to map URLs to specific endpoints (Python functions), enabling the execution of custom logic when a particular URL is accessed.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Dynamic Content:** App routes allow for dynamic content generation, enabling the passing of variables and parameters through URLs to create dynamic and interactive web pages.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **RESTful APIs:** For building RESTful APIs, app routes are crucial as they enable the definition of different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) for handling API requests at specific endpoints.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "5. **Modularity:** Flask's app routing promotes a modular and structured codebase, making it easier to maintain, scale, and expand web applications by breaking down functionality into manageable components."

    "The render_template() function in Flask is used to render these HTML templates and inject dynamic content into them. It takes an HTML template as an argument and can pass data from your Python code to the template, allowing you to generate web pages that display information based on the data provided.\n",

    "Advantages of render_template() include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It promotes clean and maintainable code by separating the business logic from the HTML presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Templates can be reused across multiple routes and pages, enhancing code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It allows you to display dynamic content by passing variables and data from your Python code to the HTML templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Ensures a consistent look and feel across your web application by using the same templates for similar page layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Simplifies web application development by enabling developers to work with familiar HTML and CSS while incorporating dynamic content and logic."

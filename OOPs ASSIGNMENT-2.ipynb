    "Abstraction is a method which helps to hide the unwanted data from the user and and shows only relevant data. The class which implements the abstraction is used as a parent class by inheriting them, hence improving readability, and reducing duplication. Abstract class act as blueprint for other classes. To create an abstract class we need to use the ABC (Abstract Base Class) module from the abc package. This module provides the ABC class, and the abstractmethod decorator is used to declare abstract methods. here is an Example:"

    "1. **Applicability:**\r\n",
    "   - T-tests are typically used when the sample size is small (less than 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown.\r\n",

    "3. **Formula:**\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "**Z-Test:**\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Applicability:**\r\n",
    "   - Z-tests are used when the sample size is large (typically above 30) and the population standard deviation is known.\r\n",
    "   - They are suitable when dealing with situations where the data is assumed to be normally distributed.\r\n",

    "   - **Scenario:** You want to test if there is a significant difference in the average test scores of two groups of students, each consisting of 20 students.\r\n",

    "The margin of error in a confidence interval represents the range within which we expect the true population parameter (such as the mean) to lie. It quantifies the precision or uncertainty associated with our estimate. A smaller margin of error indicates a more precise estimate.\r\n",

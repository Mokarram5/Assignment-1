    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, management, and manipulation of data. Databases are used to store and manage information in a structured manner, making it easier to perform tasks such as querying, updating, and analyzing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main categories of databases, i.e SQL (Structured Query Language) databases and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases. Here's a differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Structure: SQL databases are relational databases, which means they use a predefined schema to define the structure of the data. Data is organized into tables with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using keys (example : primary keys and foreign keys).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language: SQL databases use a standardized query language called SQL to interact with the data. SQL allows users to perform complex queries, joins, and aggregations on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Cases: SQL databases are well-suited for applications that require structured, well-defined data with complex relationships, such as financial systems, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, and enterprise applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database, Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "1. Structure: NoSQL databases are non-relational and often schema-less, allowing for more flexible data models. They can store unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data in various formats, such as JSON, XML, or key-value pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query Language: NoSQL databases do not rely on SQL for querying. Instead, they offer various query languages and APIs tailored to their specific data models. Some NoSQL databases support ad-hoc querying, while others may require predefined indexes for efficient data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Cases: NoSQL databases are well-suited for applications with large volumes of rapidly changing data, such as social media platforms, content management systems, real-time analytics, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Examples: MongoDB (document-oriented), Cassandra (column-family), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph), Amazon DynamoDB (key-value and document)."

    "1. **FROM**: The FROM clause specifies the tables from which the data is to be retrieved. It is the first clause to be executed, and it identifies the source tables for the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **JOIN**: If there are multiple tables in the FROM clause that need to be joined together, the JOIN clauses are executed next. These clauses specify how the tables are related and which rows should be combined.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **WHERE**: The WHERE clause is executed after the FROM and JOIN clauses. It filters the rows from the joined tables based on specified conditions. Rows that meet the criteria in the WHERE clause are included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **GROUP BY**: If a GROUP BY clause is present in the query, it is executed after the WHERE clause. The GROUP BY clause groups rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **HAVING**: The HAVING clause is executed after the GROUP BY clause. It filters the grouped rows based on aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, COUNT) and conditions. Rows that meet the criteria in the HAVING clause are included in the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **SELECT**: The SELECT clause is executed after all the preceding clauses. It specifies which columns or expressions should be included in the result set. The selected columns may include aggregate functions applied to grouped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **ORDER BY**: The ORDER BY clause is executed after the SELECT clause. It sorts the result set based on one or more columns in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **LIMIT/OFFSET**: If a LIMIT and/or OFFSET clause is used, they are executed after the ORDER BY clause. LIMIT specifies the maximum number of rows to return, while OFFSET specifies how many rows to skip from the beginning of the result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **UNION/INTERSECT/EXCEPT**: If the query involves set operations like UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT, these operations are performed last after all the other clauses. They combine or compare result sets from multiple queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that not all clauses are required in every SQL query, and the order of execution can vary based on the specific query structure. However, the order mentioned above reflects the typical sequence of clause execution in a standard SQL query."
